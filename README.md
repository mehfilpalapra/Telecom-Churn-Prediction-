# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using data analytics techniques, including data preprocessing, model building, and data visualization. The goal is to predict which customers are likely to churn, so that telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain them.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for telecom companies as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we use a variety of data analytics techniques to predict customer churn and visualize the results in Power BI for better business insights.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the raw customer data.
2. **Modeling**: Building a churn prediction model using machine learning techniques (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Visualization**: Using Power BI to create dynamic dashboards that visualize churn patterns and insights.

## Project Description

This project leverages machine learning models and data visualization tools to predict telecom customer churn. The dataset contains features like customer demographics, account information, services used, and whether the customer has churned or not.

### Objective:
- To predict whether a customer will churn or stay with the telecom company based on their profile and usage patterns.

### Deliverables:
- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained model capable of predicting customer churn.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations that provide insights into churn-related factors.
- **Code and Documentation**: The Python code used for data processing and model training, along with detailed documentation.
